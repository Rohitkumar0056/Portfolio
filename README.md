## About This Space

This repository is the digital canvas for my personal portfolio website - a living, breathing showcase of my journey as a developer, creator, and lifelong learner.

Here, code becomes a story. Every component, animation, and pixel is crafted to reflect not just my technical skills, but my personality, values, and aspirations.
